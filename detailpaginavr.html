    <h1 class="titels">PROWIJS</h1>
    <p class="teksten">Prowijs is a game which has as main goal to give players who suffer from a dutch language development disorders between the age of 10 and 12 an experience where they can improve their language skills by playing different mini games in a playfull way. First, the player has to play through a tutorial to get familiar with the control scheme, which will be used in every mini game with the help of Skippy the rabbit who will explain everything. After that, the player can pick board the zeppelin and fly to 3 different islands. <br>
        <br> Each of these islands will have a minigame with their own specific goal which are based on common problems the target group face. For example, in one of the minigames the player will have to use a bow and arrow to shoot the right signal word thatâ€™s missing from a given sentence.
        <br>
        <br> Every island will also have its own environment, there is a forest, snow, desert and tropical environment. After the player finishes one of the minigames he/she can return to the zeppelin to take on another minigame, this can be done repeatedly so that the player can really practice his/her skills by playing multiple times.
